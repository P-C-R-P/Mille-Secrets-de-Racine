# _Mille Secrets_ de Racine

---

A **textual analysis** and **data visualisation** of _Britannicus_ by Jean Racine. This project was created for the course on **Data Visualisation**, run by [Isaac Pante] at the [University of Lausanne] (UNIL). It also deployed textual analysis skills gained from the course on **Data Analysis**, run by [Aris Xanthos] and [Fran√ßois Bavaud] at UNIL.

## Description

### Central Objectives

This project aimed to create a collection of data visualisations which expressed key statistics garnered from a textual analysis of Jean Racine's _Britannicus_. This project balanced aesthetic appeal, effective communication and accessible statistics.

### Target Audience

These key statistics demonstrate the benefits of textual analysis to multiple target audiences, but, principally, students of literature and a general public interested in seeing a fresh perspective on a canonical piece of literature. By graphically representing Racine's theatrical work, this data visualisation project hopes to foreground the benfits of data analysis and computational techniques to humanities disciplines and, by extension, advocate for _Digital Humanities_ as an academic field.

### Key Features

1. Aesthetic choices - colour scheme/choice of graphics
2. Important themes - results communicated/story told (simple)
3. Responsiveness - interactivity/transitions
